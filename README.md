This program is for sizing expansion tanks in a hydronic heating or cooling system. There are (2) methods used: The ASHRAE Method and the Critical Sizing Method (both summarized in the attached Amtrol sizing guide). The GUI allows the user to enter information about the system volume, temperatures, and pressures of the system -- the result is the minimum tank acceptance volume required.
